## Course Goal
In this class I hope to gain more knowledge about digiral archeology. I do not know much about this field but I am excited to learn more and see how it can help me in my future.
I have done some research on this class over the summer and was intrigued about the idea of data management in digital archeology which I assume stems from other tech so I am sxcited to leanr more about 
this. I also like the idea of just archeology so being a computer science and being able to learn about a tech approach to archeology is exciting because there can be methods that are
non-intrusive but reach the same conclusion.
